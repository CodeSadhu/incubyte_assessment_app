# String Calculator - Flutter Edition ðŸ§®

A TDD-driven string calculator implementation for the **Software Craftsperson (Flutter)** role assessment.

## What's This About?

You asked for a script, I gave you a script... *and* a full Flutter app! ðŸš€  
Because why settle for console output when you can have animations, custom delimiters, and a UI that doesn't look like it's from 1995?

**Original Requirements:** [OBJECTIVE.md](./OBJECTIVE.md)

## Features That Go The Extra Mile

- âœ… **Pure Script**: Standalone Dart script that runs independently
- âœ… **Flutter App**: Full mobile experience with animations
- âœ… **Custom Default Delimiters**: Because sometimes commas just aren't your thing
- âœ… **Quick Example Buttons**: One-tap input for the lazy... I mean, efficient developer
- âœ… **Smooth Animations**: No Rive/Lottie (that would be overkill), just clean Flutter animations
- âœ… **TDD Throughout**: Red-Green-Refactor like a proper craftsperson
- âœ… **Comprehensive Tests**: Unit tests, integration tests, edge cases covered

## How to Run

### The Script (Original Requirement)
```bash
dart run lib/string_calculator.dart
```

### The Flutter App
```bash
flutter run
```

### Online Script Demo

### Test the APK
Check the `executables/` folder for the release APK if you want to test on a real device.

## Test Coverage

- **Unit Tests**: Core calculator logic with edge cases

Run tests: `flutter test`

## Why This Assessment Rocks ðŸŽ¯

Honestly, this was refreshing! In a world of AI-proctored tests and "reverse a binary tree" questions, you asked for something that actually matters - **clean code, TDD, and craftsmanship**. Based on this alone, Incubyte seems like the kind of place where developers can actually... develop.

If selected, I'm ready to bring this same attention to detail and go-the-extra-mile mentality to your team!
